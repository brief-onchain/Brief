# 🚀 BSC Mainnet Deployment Guide

Simple step-by-step guide to deploy your BRIEF NFA contract (BAP578-compatible) to Binance Smart Chain Mainnet.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- ✅ **Node.js version 22** installed ([Download here](https://nodejs.org/))
- ✅ **0.10 - 0.15 BNB** in your deployment wallet
- ✅ **Private key** of your deployment wallet
- ✅ **BSCScan API key** (free from [bscscan.com](https://bscscan.com))

---

## Step 1: Setup Project Environment 🔧

### 1.1 Install Node.js v22
Check your Node version:
```bash
node --version
```
Should show: `v22.x.x`

If not v22, download from: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

### 1.2 Open Project Directory
Navigate to the project folder in terminal:
```bash
cd path/to/SOGO@bnbchain-hackathon/contracts
```

### 1.3 Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
This will take 2-5 minutes.

---

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables 🔐

### 2.1 Create Environment File
Copy the example file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2.2 Edit .env File
Open `.env` in any text editor and add:

```env
# Your wallet's private key (64 characters, no 0x prefix)
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# BSC Mainnet RPC URL (use default or your own)
MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/

# BSCScan API Key for verification
BSCSCAN_API_KEY=your_bscscan_api_key_here

# Optional app naming (recommended)
BRIEF_CONTRACT_NAME=BriefAgentNFA
BRIEF_TOKEN_NAME=Brief Agent
BRIEF_TOKEN_SYMBOL=BRIEF

# Optional treasury override (default is deployer address)
TREASURY_ADDRESS=0xYourTreasuryAddressHere
```

### 2.3 Get BSCScan API Key
1. Visit https://bscscan.com
2. Sign up/Login
3. Go to **API Keys** → **Add** 
4. Copy API key to `.env`

---

## Step 3: Configure Treasury Address 💰

Use `.env` value `TREASURY_ADDRESS`. If omitted, deployer address is used.
Treasury receives minting fees after free mints are used.

---

## Step 4: Deploy Contract 🚀

### 4.1 Test Configuration
First, verify everything is set up correctly:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### 4.2 Deploy to Mainnet
Run deployment:
```bash
npm run deploy:mainnet
```

### 4.3 Expected Output
```
🚀 Deploying BriefAgentNFA...

📍 Deploying with account: 0x...
💰 Account balance: 0.15 BNB
🏦 Treasury address: 0x...

📝 Deploying upgradeable contract...
✅ Proxy deployed to: 0xABC123...        ← YOUR CONTRACT ADDRESS
✅ Implementation deployed to: 0xDEF456...

🔍 Verifying deployment...
- Name: Brief Agent
- Symbol: BRIEF
- Owner: 0x...
- Treasury: 0x...
- Mint Fee: 0.01 BNB

💾 Deployment info saved to: ./deployments/mainnet_deployment.json
```

### 📌 SAVE THESE ADDRESSES!
- **Proxy Address**: This is the only address your app/backend should use
- **Implementation**: Internal upgrade target (do not expose to users)
- Save the entire output for records

### 4.4 Bind Backend to One Contract
After deployment, set this once in your backend `.env`:

```env
BRIEF_NFA_CONTRACT=0xYourProxyAddress
```

With this config, app logic will auto-bind to one contract and users do not need to paste contract addresses.

---

## Step 5: Verify Contract on BSCScan ✅

### 5.1 Automatic Verification
```bash
npm run verify:mainnet
```

If successful, you'll see:
```
Successfully verified contract BriefAgentNFA on BscScan.
https://bscscan.com/address/0xYourContractAddress#code
```

### 5.2 Manual Verification (if auto fails)
```bash
npm run verify:manual:mainnet
```
Follow the prompts.

### 5.3 Check Verification
1. Go to BSCScan: `https://bscscan.com/address/YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
2. Look for green checkmark ✓
3. Click "Contract" tab → "Read Contract"

---

## Step 6: Interact With Your Contract 🎮

### 6.1 Using CLI Tool
```bash
npm run interact:mainnet
```

**Menu Options:**
```
📋 Choose an action:
1. Create new agent      ← Mint NFT (first 3 free!)
2. View my agents        ← See your NFTs
3. View agent details    ← Check specific NFT
4. Fund an agent        ← Add BNB to NFT
5. Withdraw from agent  ← Remove BNB from NFT
6. Update agent status  ← Enable/disable
7. Update logic address ← Change logic contract
8. Update metadata      ← Change NFT metadata
9. View contract info   ← Contract details
10. Admin functions     ← Owner only
0. Exit
```

### 6.2 First Actions
1. Select **9** to view contract info
2. Select **1** to create your first agent (free!)
3. Select **2** to view your agents

### 6.3 Using BSCScan
After verification:
1. Go to your contract on BSCScan
2. Click "Write Contract" 
3. Connect wallet (Web3)
4. Use functions directly

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Node.js Issues
```
Error: Unsupported engine
```
**Solution**: Install Node.js v22

### Compilation Errors
```
Error: Cannot find module
```
**Solution**: 
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Insufficient Funds
```
Error: insufficient funds for gas
```
**Solution**: Add more BNB to wallet (need 0.05+ BNB)

### Wrong Network
```
Error: Network mismatch
```
**Solution**: Ensure using BSC Mainnet (chainId: 56)

### Private Key Error
```
Error: Invalid private key
```
**Solution**: 
- Remove quotes from key in `.env`
- Ensure 64 characters (no 0x prefix)
- No spaces or line breaks

### Verification Failed
```
Error: Failed to verify contract
```
**Solution**:
- Wait 1 minute after deployment
- Try manual verification
- Check BSCSCAN_API_KEY is correct

## 🔒 Security Notes

1. **Private Key Safety**
   - Never share your private key
   - Use separate wallet for deployment
   - Store key offline after deployment

2. **Contract Ownership**
   - You are the owner after deployment
   - Can transfer ownership if needed
   - Owner can pause/unpause contract

3. **Treasury Management**
   - Treasury receives mint fees
   - Can be updated by owner
   - Consider using multisig wallet

4. **Upgradability**
   - Contract uses UUPS pattern
   - Only owner can upgrade
   - Test upgrades on testnet first

---

## ✨ Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Mint First NFTs**
   - Test with free mints
   - Verify metadata displays correctly
   - Check BSCScan shows NFTs

2. **Set Up Operations**
   - Configure treasury if different
